Allows to develop skill of coordinating clutch, accelerator and park brake when moving the vehicle from a stationary position.\\n\\nWhat do you need? To practice this exercise, you will need a road which has steep uphill in wide and quiet streets with minimal or no distractions.\\n\\nPrerequisites: Reasonable competency achieved in exercise-2 “flat road start” and exercise-3 “gentle hill start”.\\n\\nSet of repeatable steps:\\n\\n1. Make sure the engine is running 2. Apply the park brake firmly 3. Press clutch to the floor 4. Select gear-1 5. Look straight ahead in the direction of travel 6. Increase acceleration to 3,000+ RPM in the tachometer and hold it there (keep it at\\n\\nthat level)\\n\\n7. Gradually release the clutch to the friction point and hold it there (keep it at that level)\\n\\n8. Increase acceleration while gradually releasing the clutch from the friction point as performed in Exercise-2 “flat road start”.\\n\\n9. Notice that the vehicle is moving slowly and then rapidly gaining the speed. 10. When the clutch is fully released, rest your left foot on the floor, adjust the\\n\\naccelerator to maintain desired speed. Desirable speed is no more than 30 KMPH.\\n\\n11.
